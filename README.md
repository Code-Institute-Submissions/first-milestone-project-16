##About this website
This cake baker’s website is targeted for those interested in buying cakes and cupcakes occasions. The gallery and about section gives info about how this baker is all about creating cakes designed for individuals as per their requirement and its stand-out feature is that no two cakes are the same. The site has 4 pages for the front-end user centric project. But I will be developing it even more and adding more pages as a side project as I progress through the rest of the course.

###Features
•	The main homepage has a logo on the top-left and name and title top-centre (to appear on all 4 pages of the site)
•	Below that I used a simple navbar (which will also appear on all 4 pages of the site)
•	Navbar – Home, Gallery, About Us and Contact will take the user to the respective page when clicked)
•	The main landing page has a simple carousel and the first 2 slides when clicked would eventually link to a product list page with an ‘order now and add to cart’ feature
•	Gallery page has pictures of the baker’s works so far
•	About us page gives a quick brief about this bakery and how it stands out from others.
•	Contact page has a simple form and will eventually have an upload file/pic feature once I have completed back-end development.

###Process of creation and technologies used
•	For wireframes, I manually sketched the different pages and created other versions as I progressed coding in the site.
•	I used the Rosie’s CV project as a guideline project to create this project to help me create this as a mobile-first approach.
•	HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Font Awesome, Hover features were used to add logo, name, title and navbar, and on other parts of the site.
•	Carousel was added using code from w3schools, stackoverflow, css-tricks.com and bluesbellsbakery.co.nz and then I tailored it to my requirement.
•	Simple form was added for contact page and subscribe feature in the footer.
•	Header and Footer are constant on all pages, except that there is no footer on the gallery page.
•	About us page uses the same font as the name as the navbar to keep consistency
•	Gallery has images sourced from colleague who is an actual part-time baker and also non-watermarked google searched images were used.

###Testing

•	I initially was not committing to Git as often, but then started committing more often for major and minor changes.
•	I validated each of the html5 codes and the css codeusing w3c validators and correcting a few errors that were present on the html page.
•	Chrome dev tools was used to inspect and tailor changes.
•	Mentor session to be conducted for review……………

###Media
•	Gallery has images sourced from colleague who is an actual part-time baker and also non-watermarked google searched images were used.

####Acknowledgements
•	I received inspiration for this project from other local bakery websites in New Zealand.
•	This README file was based on help from various README files I have come across on stack, google, training github repos.
