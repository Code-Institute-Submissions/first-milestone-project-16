## About this website

This cake baker’s website is targeted for those interested in buying cakes and cupcakes occasions. 
The gallery and about section gives info about how this baker is all about creating cakes designed for individuals as per their requirement and its stand-out feature is that no two cakes are the same. 
The site has 4 pages for the front-end user centric project. But I will be developing it even more and adding more pages as a side project as I progress through the rest of the course.

## UX

__Ideal client__
- Those who live in Auckland, New Zealand
- Those looking for bespoke cakes
- Those looking for a cake shop that is not a franchisee of a larger cake company
- Those looking for cakes that are not mass-produced

__How can they achieve this?__
- Using the simple navigation bar at the top of the page
- Most other cake shop websites show alot of information about all different types of baked goods.
- This website clearly indicates what this store specializes in, i.e. no two cakes are the same.

__Client stories__
1. A new visitor can easily navigate through the site without having to search for more than a second
2. A new visitor can decide based on the gallery if the baker's works are worth investing time and money in.
3. A potential customer has the ability to submit contact information if they want a call back or email response.
4. A potential customer would be able to subscribe to the bakers monthly newsletter
5. A returning customer can go straight to contact page to upload images (future feature) of the next cake design they are interested in.


## Features

- The main homepage has a logo on the top-left and name and title top-centre (to appear on all 4 pages of the site)
- Below that I used a simple navbar (which will also appear on all 4 pages of the site)
- Navbar – Home, Gallery, About Us and Contact will take the user to the respective page when clicked)
- The main landing page has a simple carousel and the first 2 slides when clicked would eventually link to a product list page with an ‘order now and add to cart’ feature
- Gallery page has pictures of the baker’s works so far
- About us page gives a quick brief about this bakery and how it stands out from others.
- Contact page has a simple form and will eventually have an upload file/pic feature once I have completed back-end development.

### Process of creation and technologies used

- For __wireframes__, I __manually sketched__ the different pages and created other versions as I progressed coding in the site.
- I used the Resume mini-project as a guideline project to create this project to help me create this as a mobile-first approach.
- __HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Font Awesome__, Hover features were used to add logo, name, title and navbar, and on other parts of the site.
- __Carousel__ was added using code from w3schools, stackoverflow, css-tricks.com and bluesbellsbakery.co.nz and then I tailored it to my requirement.
- __Simple form__ was added for contact page and subscribe feature in the footer.
- Header and Footer are constant on all pages, except that there is no footer on the gallery page.
- About us page uses the same font as the name as the navbar to keep consistency
- Gallery has images sourced from colleague who is an actual part-time baker and also non-watermarked google searched images were used.

### Testing

- I initially was not committing to Git as often, but then started committing more often for major and minor changes.
- I validated each of the html5 codes and the css codeusing __w3c validators__ and correcting a few errors that were present on the html page.
- __Chrome dev tools__ was used to inspect and tailor changes.
- Mentor session to be conducted for review……………

## Deployment
This project was developed using the Cloud9 IDE, committed to git and pushed to GitHub.

To deploy this page to GitHub I did the following:
1. Logged into __GitHub__
2. Clicked on _settings_ page of my milestone project repository
3. In __GitHub Pages__ section, changed Source from __None__ to __Master Branch__
4. [GitHUb Link](https://sheldon18.github.io/first-milestone-project) is then generated
